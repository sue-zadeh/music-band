# music-band https://sedrz.github.io/music-band/
(This is read me which was wrote on April 2019)
This is my first project on the online course “full stack web developer”. 
It should have been about a  band, but I wanted to choose a music band from my country, as I know more about them. So, my website is about a Persian popusic
band called "Rastak". After doing research and gathering the necessary information about their band I designed this website for them.
This project is written in HTML & CSS using Dream weaver software and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.

First, I prepared an initial wireframe using pen and paper, then improved it as I proceeded with the design process and 
other appealing ideas came to me. I have put my framework here as well.
The most important thing I tried to achieve on this website was encouraging users to book this band for their events.
To achieve this goal, I tried to design beautiful pages regarding my knowledge.  
My mentor- Moosa Hassan- helped me make it nicer. I appreciate his help a lot..
