# music-band https://sue-raisianzadeh.github.io/music-band/


This is my first project on the online course “full stack web developer” in 2019. I edited it in 2021. 

This project is written in HTML5 & CSS3 using visual studio software and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
as well I used photoshop to prepare pictures and 1 animated pics on the top of "Photos" page.

 This website is about a Persian folk music band called "Rastak".

The most important thing I tried to achieve on this website was encouraging users to book this band for their events.
To achieve this goal, I tried to design beautiful pages regarding my knowledge.
